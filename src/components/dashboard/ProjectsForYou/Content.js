    title: "Investment as easy as shopping online",
    description: `Here is an upcoming startup creating a platform where small businesses who have no stocks listed on any stock exchange can collect funds through the public. Furthermore, they define their company as a place where people with upright mindsets can correlate with each other and create growth through valuable investments and consumption.<br /><br />

    The company plans to facilitate crowdfunding. Crowdfunding is collecting funds from the public on a social network platforms without using financial institutions. There are 4 types of crowdfunding.<br /><br />
    
    <b>Reward type:</b> (sponsor type) those who contributed the money can receive products or services in response.<br />
    
    <b>Investment type:</b> (equity investment type) those who contributed the money in this type can receive equity or bonds in response.<br />
    
    <b>Loan type:</b> P2P loaning is in this case. Through a small amount of loaning, individuals or small business owners can pay the money back.<br />
    
    <b>Donation type:</b> without the conditions for rewards, money is contributed as a donation.<br /><br />
    
    Some of the benefits in the investors and consumers prospective are <br /><br />
    
    1. Investors can choose to whom they would contribute money to. They can look at the business models of each startup or entrepreneur who needs money.<br />
    2. Startups can easily do funding. It makes funding like shopping, fast and easy.<br />
    3. Consumers can get benefit in terms of income tax deduction and explore new startups and products that can benefit the country and economy.<br /><br />
    
    Well! Are there any other benefits that can be still introduced like "Helping startups reduce tax rate imposed on revenues(at least 10% lower than a P2P type of crowdfunding)" or else "Companies who succeeded through crowdfunding and met some conditions can list their stocks at stock exchange platforms as special cases".
    <br /><br />
    We would like to hear from you how you would like to contribute and also any other ideas that can help the platform whether it may be related to benefits, features, revenue model etc. If you are someone who's interested in making investment as easy as shopping online, mention the role that you are interested in and schedule your interview for the fellowship program today.`,

    title: "New generation of offline ads using AI & IoT",
    description: `Here is a startup planning to introduce a new generation of offline ads around the world. A win-win for both the advertiser and the client. Those looking to make some extra income can work with an advertiser to have their ads placed on their cars. However, what kind of car ads attract the most attention? This is where AI comes in. We are seeking out some of the passionate Artificial Intelligence enthusiasts interested in addressing this challenge.<br /><br />

    By combining AI, IOT, and Machine Learning, we can gather data on the performance of each Ads. The data collected will include the distance/locations traveled, the number of people reached, and the number of people who actually saw the ad. The platform can provide real-time data tracking by tracking and measuring the campaign in real-time.<br /><br />
    
    By using special sensors we can also use face recognition to gather data on total ads impressions as well as the demographics of the audience.<br /><br />
    
    Billboards have high costs are only located in fixed locations. The data can’t be measured. Car ads, on the other hand, cost less and someone as the advertiser can select the location and measure their CPM (Cost per Mile). Advertisers will get detailed reports every month with all the data. Best of all they can choose which driver to use based on their driving location and habits.
    <br /><br />
    The process that we plan to introduce to register a driver is also simple. Drivers just need to fill out the driver application. The application will as simple questions about where you normally drive. Then the platform will match the driver with a brand that likes their driving habits. The driver’s car is wrapped with the advertisement and they will get paid every month through direct deposit. They will then come to take the add off at the end of the campaign.
    <br /><br />
    Every year companies around the world pay billions of dollars for outdoor advertising but they have no clue about the performance and how to optimize it digitally. But today with the advancement of technology, we can apply machine learning and IoT to track and provide useful data for outdoor ads. Therefore, this will be crucial to making it valuable and reasonable for the customer.
    <br /><br />
    Join us in changing the traditional advertising and helping companies track their offline ads easily.`,
